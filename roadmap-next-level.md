# Shabito.net - Next Level Roadmap

## Goal
Elevate conversion, trust, and discoverability while preserving the current visual identity and tone.

## Highest-Impact Next Step

### Add "How It Works" + Proof Strip
Add one compact section on both homepage and service page.

#### How It Works (3 steps)
1. You send style + content
2. I design and send a preview
3. You review, then publish

#### Proof Chips
- Published Chaturbate apps
- $25 one-time pricing
- 1-3 day turnaround

**Why this matters:** Visitors decide quickly. Clear process + trust signals increase confidence and contact intent.

## Prioritized Execution Plan

### 1) Conversion Trust Layer (Week 1)
- Add "How It Works" section to homepage and service page.
- Add proof strip near top fold.
- Keep existing bento style and spacing language.

### 2) Portfolio Clarity (Week 2)
- Add short factual notes per bio card (e.g. custom layout, mobile-ready structure).
- Optionally show delivery date for recency.

### 3) Contact Friction Reduction (Week 3)
- Add a small "Start by email with these 3 details" helper in contact section:
  - style direction
  - profile content
  - username + priorities

### 4) Measurement Setup (Week 3-4)
- Add lightweight analytics (Plausible or GoatCounter).
- Track:
  - mailto clicks
  - service CTA clicks
  - portfolio outbound clicks

### 5) Content Readiness (Week 4)
- Publish one cornerstone article before fully promoting blog.
- Suggested first article:
  - "How much does a Chaturbate bio designer cost?"
